This repository holds the for the eXist-db XQuery Versioning extension module.

## Compiling
Requirements: Java 8, Maven 3.

1. `git clone https://github.com/eXist-db/xquery-versioning-module.git`

2. `cd xquery-versioning-module`

3. `mvn package`

You will then find a file named similar to `target/xquery-versioning-module-1.1.xar`.

## Installation into eXist-db
You can install the module into eXist-db in either one of two ways:
1. As an EXPath Package (.xar file)
2. Directly as a XQuery Java Extension Module (.jar file)

### EXPath Package Installation into eXist-db (.xar)
1. If you have compiled yourself (see above), you can take the `target/xquery-versioning-module-1.1.xar` file and upload it via eXist's EXPath Package Manager app in its Dashboard

2. Otherwise, the latest release version will also be available from the eXist's EXPath Package Manager app in its Dashboard


### Direct Installation into eXist-db (.jar)
1. If you have compiled yourself (see above), copy `target/xquery-versioning-module-1.1-exist.jar` to `$EXIST_HOME/lib/user`.

2. Edit `$EXIST_HOME/conf.xml` and add the following to the `<builtin-modules>`:

    ```xml
    <module uri="http://exist-db.org/xquery/versioning" class="org.exist.versioning.xquery.VersioningModule"/>
    ```

3. Restart eXist-db


### Example `collection.xconf` Trigger Configuration
```xml
<collection xmlns="http://exist-db.org/collection-config/1.0">
    <triggers>
        <trigger event="create,update,delete"
            class="org.exist.versioning.VersioningTrigger">
            <parameter name="overwrite" value="no"/>
        </trigger>
    </triggers>
</collection>
```


### API Overview

Namespace URI: `http://exist-db.org/xquery/versioning`

Namespace Prefix: `versioning`

Class: `org.exist.versioning.xquery.VersioningModule`


1. To find the differences between two nodes:
    ```xquery
    versioning:diff($a as node(), $b as node()) as node()
    ```

2. To apply a patch to a node:
    ```xquery
    versioning:patch($node as node(), $patch as node()) as item()
    ```

3. To annotate a node:
    ```xquery
    versioning:annotate($node as node(), $patch as node()) as item()
    ```


### Utility API Overview

Namespace URI: `http://exist-db.org/versioning`

Namespace Prefix: `v`

file: `versioning.xqm`

1. Return all revisions of the specified document as a sequence of xs:integer revision numbers in ascending order:
    ```xquery
    v:revisions($doc as node()) as xs:integer*
    ```

2. Return all version docs, including the full diff, for the specified document:
    ```xquery
    v:versions($doc as node()) as element(v:version)*
    ```

3. Restore a certain revision of a document by applying a sequence of diffs and return it as an in-memory node:
    ```xquery
    v:doc($doc as node(), $rev as xs:integer?) as node()*
    ```

4. Apply a given patch on a document:
    ```xquery
    v:apply-patch($doc as node(), $diffs as element(v:version)*)
    ```

5. For the document passed as first argument, retrieve the revision specified in the second argument. Generate a diff between both version, i.e. **HEAD** and the given revision:
    ```xquery
    v:diff($doc as node(), $rev as xs:integer) as element(v:version)?
    ```

6. Return an XML document in which all changes between ``$rev` and ``$rev - 1` are annotated.
    ```xquery
    v:annotate($doc as node(), $rev as xs:integer)
    ```

7. Check if there are any revisions in the database which are newer than the version identified by the specified base revision and key:
    ```xquery
    v:find-newer-revision($doc as node(), $base as xs:integer, $key as xs:string) as element(v:version)?
    ```

8. Returns an XML fragment showing the version history of the  document to which the specified node belongs. All revisions are listed with date and user, but without the detailed diff:
    ```xquery
    v:history($doc as node()) as element(v:history)
    ```
